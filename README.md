# Project 2: Indiefinder- A fast way to find and support indie video games!

## Summary
Indiefinder is a website that is made to help indie video games get found and supported by people who want something new and fresh in the gaming industry. By creating a library of games that people can seach through, people can easily find new games made by smaller creators or teams. To make it even more unique, each page for a specific game will show you:
1. Where you can find the game,
2. How much the game is on different sites and consoles (as well as possible sales) to help you get the best option,
3. A basic summary of the game and information about it's creators,
4. A quick show of ratings when applicable,
5. And for a small fee to the creator,  donation option for the creators so fans can support them besides buying the game itself.

The point of this website is to solve a few major problems in the gaming industry; when bigger game companies overshadow smaller games making it difficult to find good indie games in their respective genres. The user should be able to easily find a new game in their favorite genre(s) and do research on where they can get the game as well as what to expect with it.
