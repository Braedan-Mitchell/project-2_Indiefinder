            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>Indie finder works very simply: we look for indie games personally recommended by <b>you</b>! We check to make sure they are appropriate for an average audience, which means no nudity or explicit content, then we check to make sure it's quality and engaging for players by checking reviews and even playing some ourselves. If the game meets our standards, we add it to the catalog and you'll see it on our game library soon after!</p>
